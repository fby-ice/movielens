# movielens

Evaluating k-nearest neighbors and singular value decomposition techniques for collaborative filtering recommender systems

## Variables

*int* `userId`: the integer ID of the anonymized user  
*int* `movieId`: the integer ID of the movie  
*int* `rating`: integer rating ranging from 1 to 5 given by the user to the movie  
*int* `timestamp`: the number of seconds had elapsed since the Unix epoch until the user rated the movie  

## Files

Aside from `README.md`, the repository contains 1 subdirectory and 3 other files:

1. `ml-100k`, the folder which contains the MovieLens 100K dataset
1. `preprocessing.R`, the R script for validating the data
1. `movielens.ipynb`, the notebook in which the k-NN and SVD++ algorithms are implemented and compared
1. `movielens.html`, the exported HTML version of `movielens.ipynb` for browser-viewing

## Generating recommendations

To generate movie recommendations for a specific user:

1. Run `recommend.py`.
1. Enter the ID of the user for which you want to produce recommendations.
1. Enter the number of recommendations.
